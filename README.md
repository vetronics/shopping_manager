---

### ü™ü Windows

1. **Install Python:**
   - Download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - ‚úÖ Check the box **‚ÄúAdd Python to PATH‚Äù** before clicking *Install Now*

2. **Open the terminal:**
   - Press `Windows + S`, search for **Command Prompt**, **PowerShell**, or **Windows Terminal**

3. **Install `pyfiglet`:**
   - Run the following command in your terminal:
   
     `pip install pyfiglet`

   > If `pip` is not recognized, try this alternative command:
   
     `python -m pip install pyfiglet`

4. **Run the script:**
   - On **Windows**, you can **double-click** the `shopping_manager.py` file to run the script. The terminal window will appear, and you can interact with the application.
   - If double-clicking doesn't work (i.e., the terminal closes immediately), open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**, navigate to the script's folder, and run:

     `python shopping_manager.py`

5. **Using Docker (Alternative):**
   If you'd like to run the app using Docker, follow these steps:

   - **Dockerfile:** Ensure the `Dockerfile` is in your project folder with the following content:

     ```Dockerfile
     FROM python:3.13-slim

     WORKDIR /app

     # Install system packages (e.g., git)
     RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y git && apt-get upgrade -y

     # Install Python libraries directly
     RUN pip install --no-cache-dir requests pyfiglet

     # Clone the Git repository
     RUN git clone https://github.com/vetronics/shopping_manager.git \
         && mv shopping_manager/* . \
         && rm -rf shopping_manager

     # Run the app
     CMD ["python", "shopping_manager.py"]
     ```

   - **Build the Docker image:**
     In your terminal, navigate to the project folder (where the `Dockerfile` is located) and run:

     ```bash
     docker build -t shopping-manager .
     ```

   - **Run the Docker container:**
     Once the image is built, you can run it with:

     ```bash
     docker run -it shopping-manager
     ```
