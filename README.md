## ‚úÖ Setup Checklist

* [x] Install Python 3
* [x] Add Python to PATH (Windows)
* [x] Open Terminal or Command Prompt
* [x] Install `pyfiglet,pandas,matplotlib` with pip

---

## üöÄ How to Run

1. **Windows:**

   * **Double-click** the `shopping_manager.py` file to run the script on Windows.
   * If double-clicking doesn't work (i.e., the terminal closes immediately), open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**, navigate to the script's directory, and run:

     ```bash
     python shopping_manager.py
     ```

2. **macOS and Linux (Debian/Ubuntu/Fedora):**

   * Open **Terminal**, navigate to the script's directory, and run:

     ```bash
     python3 shopping_manager.py
     ```

   > Use `python` if `python3` doesn't work on your system.

---

## üìÇ File Management

* The app saves shopping list items and their values in local `.csv` files.
* Ensure you have read/write permissions in the script directory.

---

## üßæ Example Use Case

* Add items like `Milk`, `Eggs`, or `Bread`.
* Assign values like cost or quantity.
* Track total item count and sum of values.
* Remove or update items as needed.

---

## üß∞ Troubleshooting

* **Command not found**: Use `python3` or `pip3`.
* **Permission denied**: Run as administrator or use `sudo` on GNU/Linux machines.

## Development Environment: Visual Studio Community Edition

The scripts were written and tested using **Visual Studio Community Edition**, a free and feature-rich integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft. While Visual Studio is widely used for C# and .NET development, it also provides excellent support for Python development through the **Python Development workload**, which includes tools like:

- Python interpreter and virtual environment support  
- Integrated terminal for running Python scripts  
- Intelligent code completion (IntelliSense)  
- Debugging tools  
- Code navigation (go to definition, find references)

Visual Studio Community Edition allows Python developers to take advantage of a full-fledged IDE with powerful features like **Git integration**, **unit testing support**, and **built-in code analysis** tools. It provides a solid foundation for developing Python applications related to shopping and inventory management while maintaining a professional, user-friendly environment.

By using Visual Studio Community Edition, developers can streamline the process of coding, debugging, and testing Python scripts in a single platform, making it an ideal choice for both beginners and experienced developers.


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Compatibility Notes

If you're running the script on **macOS** or **Linux** (including **Fedora**, **Debian**, **Ubuntu**), you should **comment out** the following lines in the script:

```python
# os.system("cls")  # Windows-specific clear screen
# os.system("title shopping manager")  # Set terminal window title (Windows)
# os.system("color 05")  # Change text color (Windows)
```
